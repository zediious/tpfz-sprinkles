With this mod list, you are able to use a controller and access nearly all of the required keybinds through the use of a few optional mods. You shouldn't have any issues performing this process on existing saves.

## Switching to Controller

Follow these steps to switch from Keyboard and Mouse to Controller;

1. In the left pane of Mod Organizer, scroll all the way to the bottom, and find the **"CONTROLLER SETUP (OPTIONAL)"** separator. You will find three mods in this separator.

2. **DISABLE** the *"Keyboard Keybinds"* mod, and **ENABLE** the *"Gamepad Plus Plus"* and *"Complete Controller Setup"* mods.

3. Leave the MCM Recorder preset mods untouched.

At this point, you should load the game, and load into your save. Then, follow the below instructions

1. Open the pause menu, and navigate to Controls. Reset your controls to default (key/button to do so is shown at the bottom of the GUI)

2. Open the MCM menu named **MCM Recorder**, and click on the **"AurbaesenceController"** preset. Use the Run option, then close the MCM.

3. Re-open the MCM, open the **Gamepad++** MCM menu. Navigate to **Presets & Info** > **Load Preset** > **Aurbaesence**. After selecting **Aurbaesence**, close the MCM menu completely.

4. Re-open the MCM menu, and open **Gamepad++** once again. Open the **Keys & Settings** page, press OK to the prompt, then close the MCM menu. **If you don't see a prompt, simply close the MCM menu.**

Confirm that the the controller bindings are working as [listed on the bindings documentation](../../gameplay-guide/importanthotkeys). Now, you are ready to use your controller!

## Switching back to Keyboard/Mouse

If you wish to move back to the keyboard primarily, you must follow the below steps;

1. In the left pane of Mod Organizer, scroll all the way to the bottom, and find the **"CONTROLLER SETUP (OPTIONAL)"** separator. You will find three mods in this separator.

2. **ENABLE** the *"Keyboard Keybinds"* mod, and **DISABLE** the *"Gamepad Plus Plus"* and *"Complete Controller Setup"* mods.

3. In game, open the MCM menu, then open the MCM menu named **MCM Recorder**, and click on the **"AurbaesenceKeyboard"** preset. Use the Run option, then close the MCM.

This will return the keybinds to their original state.
